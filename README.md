# Bordle

## Description

`Bash + Wordle == Bordle`

A Wordle Terminal User Interface (TUI) written entirely in Bash.

## Installation

Installation is as simple as wget'ing the `bordle.sh` file.

## Usage

Make sure to change permissions on the `bordle.sh` file so that it is executable (`chmod +x` or `chmod 755`
for linux users). If you are on Windows, ensure you have a Bash binary installed (in an environment like cygwin
or git-bash). If you haven't added the binary to your environment you should do that. From there, run:

`bash bordle.sh` 

or

`sh bordle.sh`

and you'll be impressing your friends with your (b)ordle skills in no time!
